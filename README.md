# xpsfc
This originally started out as a system file checking script for Windows XP, but in its current state is a system file checker for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10.

## what it does:

It's like a doctor check up for your computer.
also check the comments in the script

##installation:

**On Windows XP**, put a windows xp sp3 iso file in the same directory as the script and name it winxpsp3.so
or change it in the script.

**On Windows Vista+**, run this script as administrator and cross your fingers.
